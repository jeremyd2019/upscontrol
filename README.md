# upscontrol
esp8266 code to communicate with/control a tripplite SU1000rt2u ups

to start with, will probably just include a telnet to uart.  then, I may try adding some logic to it.

See [NUT's tripplite SU driver](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/blob/master/drivers/tripplitesu.c)

See [the manual](docs/smartonline_su1000rtxl2u.pdf).
